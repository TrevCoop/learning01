# learning01
First repository. I am learning Git and GitHub for 03-04-2017.

I dont't yet know anything about software licenses so I am keeping this without any for now. 

I am going through the Hello World walkthrough right now. Here is an edit that I will merge back into the master branch.

I made a successful pull request and merge of a branch titled readme-edits.md

Now I am a little familiar with GitHub.com 

My next task will be to learn to use Git on the command line and clone my repository.

Topics to learn Git from command line (https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/fr/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf): 
Git installation,
configure tooling,
creating repositories,
making changes,
group changes,
refactoring,
saving,
reviewing,
redoing commits,
syncing changes.
