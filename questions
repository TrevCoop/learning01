Questions I have:

Here's a good resource, the Git Glossary: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary

-What is gist? I read the Wiki on it but am still unsure of the usage scenario. I guess they are small bits of code people make public.
-What is GitHub's student developer pack? Apparently I can qualify for a host of discounted developer tools with my student ID.
